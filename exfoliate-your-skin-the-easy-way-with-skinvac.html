                    <h2>What makes a good Face Exfoliant?</h2>
                    <p>
                      The Skinvac Face Exfoliation cloth has super fine fibres woven into a gridded texture that works just like gritty face scrub. The ups and down ridges of the surface knit together to form the exfoliant. It is a physical exfoliant that you can wrap around your fingers to make a pad. It exfoliates comfortably without drying out your face. Here is a close up of the gridded texture in the video below.
                    </p>
